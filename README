Playing with nodebox, this is a horrifically CPU-intensive
proof-of-conecpt bandwidth monitor which has multiple scales.

This one just has two: "fast" samples of one per "however fast we can
monitor" and "slow" of one pixel per 10 seconds. If you mess with the
code, there's a few drawing options and such.

A real implementation might want to use something like RRD, better
monitoring, faster drawing. Perhaps I'm using nodebox in a really bad
way...
